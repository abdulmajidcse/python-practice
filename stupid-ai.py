"""We all know about Google's gemini AI; it is one of the most interesting topics nowadays in Silicon Valley. Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, meaning it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, image, and video. [Source: Google DeepMind]

Now, we are emulating gemini AI and creating our own AI to perform various types of operations with it.

As a gesture of respect, we have decided to name our AI by reversing the name of Google's new AI.

In this problem, you just need to print the name of our new AI. Simple, right?

Input Format

no input

Constraints

none

Output Format

our new ai name(without any space or new line, and in lowercase.)"""

google_ai = "gemini"

our_ai = google_ai[::-1]

print("Our AI is", our_ai)
